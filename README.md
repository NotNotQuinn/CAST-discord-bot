# CAST-discord-bot
CAST stands for Custom Alert System for Twitch. I am simpily doing this project for fun, and to learn python. **You are free to run this code on your own bot account, *however you must include the license attached.*** I would apreciate that you also keep the credits built in to the commands. 
## Using The Bot
1. Read the `LISENCE` in full.
2. Make sure you have a recent version of [python installed and added to PATH](https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/).
3. Then **run `Start.bat`**.
## Editing the bot.
You can do whatever you want basicaly, but make sure to read the `LICENSE`.
